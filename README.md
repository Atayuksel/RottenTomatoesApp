# RottenTomatoesApp
iOS application using Rotten Tomatoes API

An application that displays Box Office, In Theaters, Up Coming, Opening movies fetched via Rotten Tomatoes API.

I used AFNetworking and SDWebImage library for networking.
In order to fetch movie posters asynchronously, SDWebImage library is used.

User also can make a search in the application. There are 5 tabs in the homepage, four of them represending 
Box Office, In Theaters, Up Coming, Opening movies and last tab is used for search.

In film detail screen user can see details of the movie via swiping up and close detail view via swiping down.
